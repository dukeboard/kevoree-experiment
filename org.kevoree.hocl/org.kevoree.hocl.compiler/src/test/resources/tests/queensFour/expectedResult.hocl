 * Ecample of an NP-complete problem: the n-queen problem
 *
 * Find the positions of n queens on a checkboard of size n such
 * that no queen can capture another one. In other words, for each
 * queen on the checkboard there is no other queen on the same line,
 * or the same column, or the same diagonal.
 *
 *  In this program, we consider one queen by line (so no conflict on
 *  one line). Queens are represented by pairs "Ri":c where "Ri" is her
 *  name, and c her vertical position (column).
